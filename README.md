# Arduino-DDS-Synthesizer
Arduino Synthesizer using DDS

Originally based on Elliot William's code:
https://github.com/hexagon5un/barking_dogs_dds_demo

Changed to Support:
* Quater, Eight, Half, and Whole Notes
* Staccato ending notes so we can hear the differences between notes
* Dynamic tempo changes
* Rest (Silent notes)

## Additional Functionality
* Build low/high pass filters as part of the hardware
